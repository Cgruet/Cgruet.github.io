No longer commissioner as of January 2023.</p>

Marcus has consistently had one of the worst teams each season, yet has evaded punishment and snuck into the playoffs each season, notably being an opening round dynasty-killer the past two seasons.</p>

Although there were some complaints about disrespectful trade negotiations, David is sure to be a great addition to the league, and his already-proven draft ability will make him a tough opponent for years to come.</p>

Spencer's team took a bit of a dive after relocating to Tampa Bay in 2019, yet he did just well enough to evade a night with Zac in Columbus.</p>

                <p><b>Bio:</b> The owner of the most dominant team in a single-season, Logan has been on both ends of the spectrum. In the inaugural year, he finished the regular season dead-last, only to follow that up the next year with a championship and the most points in LOOG regular season history. Like his date to the second banquet, Logan's teams have taken on a few different identities, and his franchise is now displaying its new name, "Cactus Jack's Cowpokes". Took over role as commissioner in January 2023</p>

Correlation doesn't always equal causation, but immediately following marriage in the summer of 2019, Josh's fantasy game took a hit, as he tinkered himself straight to last place. However, Josh seems to have motivation to do better in future seasons.</p>

                <p><b>Bio:</b> The LOOG epitome of "always a bridesmaid, but never the bride", Shawn has had arguably the most frustrating run in LOOG history. His name is written all over the LOOG record books in the championship category, except where it truly matters: Championships Won. Already being talked in the same circles as the Bills teams of the early 90's, Shawn will look to finally get the monkey off his back next year and bring the first and likely only football shampionship to southwest Ohio.</p>

                <p><b>Bio:</b> With the LOOG at 11 teams after adding David, Zac was added as a second expansion team in 2020 byway of a close and controversial 6-5 vote. Zac struggled in his first season, with an interesting pick of Lamar Jackson at #1 overall, yet he was still able to sneak into the playoffs. Expectations are low for Zac as an owner, but it will be interesting to see if he continues to improve as time goes on or if he will meet most's expectations and become a LOOG bottom feeder.</p>
